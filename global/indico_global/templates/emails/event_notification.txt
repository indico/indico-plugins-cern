        In order to separate institutional and hosted content under `indico.cern.ch`,
        and to make it possible to provide Indico to even more researchers worldwide,
        we are launching `indico.global`, a new Indico service hosted at CERN and open
        to the whole world.

        You can find more about it in our blog post announcement:
        <https://getindico.io/indico/global/2024/10/09/indico-global.html>

        With the launch of `indico.global`, we will be moving all content currently under
        the `Global Indico` category to the new server. Old links will still work, and will
        be automatically redirected to the new URLs. However, any new events will be created
        directly under the https://indico.global/ domain name after the migration.

        The migration will happen in January 2025 and you will receive an e-mail with the
        new URLs for your events once it's concluded.

        On the day of the migration, all your events will become read-only for a few hours,
        while we're moving everything to the new server.

        In the unlikely scenario that any of your events are CERN-organized, we recommend
        that you move them to another category. You should do so **before** the migration
        date in order to avoid them being moved to the new server.

        {%- if group_acls %}

            IMPORTANT: Your event currently uses CERN e-groups to grant access:
            {{ group_acls|sort|join(', ') }}

            Since this is a very CERN-specific feature, it will no longer be supported on
            `indico.global`. You may create a custom group ("Event Role") instead:
            <https://learn.getindico.io/custom_roles/#event-roles>

            Otherwise, without any action on your side, people who got privileges based on
            their e-group membership will simply lose them after the migratio.
        {%- endif %}

        Do not hesitate to reach out to us at <indico-team@cern.ch> if you have questions.
        In case you no longer actively use Indico Global, or are no longer involved in
        managing it, feel free to simply ignore this email.

        Best regards,
        The Indico Team
