# indico-plugin-i18n-demo

This is a plugin intended for the [i18n demo
instance](https://localization-demo.getindico.io). It does two things:

- All emails are redirected to the user who sent them (avoids spamming random
  people and lets you check email translations)
- Adds a new **Clone** button to the example events. When clicked, the
  corresponding event is cloned into your own personal subcategory and you get
  management rights to it. This way, you can see the management area without
  accidentally modifying the example events.
