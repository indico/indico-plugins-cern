            You are receiving this message because you are managing the following Indico

            You are receiving this message because you are managing the following Indico

        You have already received a notification about the migration on the weekend of the
        18th/19th, and a reminder a few days ago, so we're not going to repeat the information
        in here.

        However, there is one thing we'd like to point out: As per the Global Indico fair-use
        policy, "The usage of the CERN Zoom service is strictly limited to CERN activities" and
        "using Global Indico does not grant you the right to use the CERN Zoom service":
        <https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal?id=kb_article&n=KB0004606>

        Nonetheless this is a limitation which we did not actively enforce, so those with a CERN
        Zoom account (because they are affiliated with CERN) were able to create Zoom meetings
        even for events inside Indico Global.

        But since it makes no sense to even have this Zoom integration on indico.global (which is
        not meant for CERN events after all), the Zoom meeting links will disappear from the events
        linked above, and you will not be able to create new ones.

        You can, however, add any Zoom link to the event in the event description or as material.

        In case any of the events above are CERN-organized, or otherwise have links to CERN which
        justify keeping them on indico.cern.ch, and using e.g. the CERN Zoom infrastructure, we
        recommend that you move them to another category. You should do so ASAP (this week!) in
        order to avoid them being moved to the new server.

        Do not hesitate to reach out to us at <indico-team@cern.ch> if you have questions, or need
        help moving the events.

        In case you no longer actively use Indico Global, or are no longer involved in managing the
        events above, feel free to simply ignore this email as well.

        PS: Apologies if you already received an email about this topic, we contacted some of you
        manually. This is an email that is sent for all affected events. If you are already in touch
        with us, simply ignore it.

        Best regards,
        The Indico Team
