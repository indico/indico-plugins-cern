        In order to separate institutional and hosted content under `indico.cern.ch`,
        and to make it possible to provide Indico to even more researchers worldwide,
        we are launching `indico.global`, a new Indico service hosted at CERN and open
        to the whole world.

        You can find more about it in our blog post announcement:
        <https://getindico.io/indico/global/2024/10/09/indico-global.html>

        With the launch of `indico.global`, we will be moving all content currently under
        the `Global Indico` category to the new server. Old links will still work, and will
        be automatically redirected to the new URLs. However, any new events will be created
        directly under the https://indico.global/ domain name after the migration.

        The migration will happen in January 2025, on the weekend of the 18th/19th. During the
        migration, all your categories and events will become read-only for a few hours, while
        we're moving everything to the new server.

        In the unlikely scenario that you have CERN-organized events in your category, we
        recommend that you move them to another category. You should do so **before** the
        migration date in order to avoid them being moved to the new server.

        {%- if group_acls %}

            IMPORTANT: Your category currently uses CERN e-groups to grant access:
            {{ group_acls|sort|join(', ') }}

            Since this is a very CERN-specific feature, it will no longer be supported on
            `indico.global`. You may create a custom group ("Category Role") instead if you
            want to keep managing access in a single place:
            <https://learn.getindico.io/custom_roles/#category-roles>

            Otherwise, without any action on your side, people who got privileges based on
            their e-group membership will simply lose them after the migration.
        {%- endif %}

        Do not hesitate to reach out to us at <indico-team@cern.ch> if you have questions.
        In case you no longer actively use the category, or are no longer involved in
        managing it, feel free to simply ignore this email.

        PS: We will also notify the managers of recent and upcoming events in your categories
        individually, so no need for you to forward this email to them.

        Best regards,
        The Indico Team
